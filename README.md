# Solid Future Working Group

This is the working group for next major version of Solid. It was formed to provide support to the community through the release and focus on presenting and getting feedback on the direction Solid is heading. The working group is focused around online conversations which you can access by going to the [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-workgroup/discussions).
